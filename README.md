Yet another JSON library build on top of [dartz](https://pub.dev/packages/dartz), loosely inspired by [circe](https://circe.github.io/circe/).

***Use at your own risk. Things are very much still in flux and I'm not concerned about breaking things yet.***

To get a quick sense of what this library provides, please look at the [example](https://github.com/cranst0n/pj/blob/main/example/main.dart). If it seems like something that may be useful to you, check out
the API reference for more combinators.
